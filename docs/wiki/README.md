# SlopRock Plus — Wiki

> Browse, play, and practice your custom song collection — entirely in your browser, entirely in Docker.

SlopRock Plus is a self-hosted web application that turns your CDLC library into an interactive note highway player. It runs as a single Docker Compose stack: no cloud accounts, no subscriptions, no internet required after setup.

---

## What it does

```
Your DLC folder  →  Auto-scanned  →  Library browser  →  Note highway player
      (Sloppak / Loose)                  (search, filter, favourites)
                                                              |
                                               Real-time pitch detection
                                               A-B loop practice
                                               Per-profile scores & history
                                               VST plugin chain (via SlopAudio Connect)
```

**Supported formats**

| Format | Description |
|---|---|
| Sloppak | SlopRock's open format — unencrypted ZIP or directory with a YAML manifest |
| Loose | Unpacked folder containing XMLs or a manifest — convenient for manual editing |

## How the system fits together

```
                    Browser
                       |
              +---------+---------+
              |                   |
          Frontend            WebSocket
        (Vue 3 SPA)       (real-time events)
              |                   |
              +-------------------+
                       |
                Fastify Backend  :8085
                       |
          +------------+------------+
          |            |            |
     PostgreSQL      MinIO     SlopAudio
      :5432         :9000       Connect
   (metadata,    (covers,       (VST chain,
   sessions,      audio,    pitch detection)
   scores)        stems)
```

Five Docker services, all defined in `docker-compose.yml`. The browser talks only to the frontend on port **8006**; the frontend proxies API and WebSocket traffic to the backend on port **8085**.

---

## Quick-start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johncoco12/SlopRock-Plus
cd SlopRock-Plus
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://localhost:8006** in your browser. The library scans in the background — the UI is usable immediately.

**Environment variables** (set in `docker-compose.yml` or a `.env` file)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DLC_PATH` | `./dlc` | Host path to your song library folder |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `trace` / `debug` / `info` / `warn` / `error` |
| `LOG_PRETTY` | `true` | `false` for JSON logs (Loki, ELK, Promtail) |
| `SAC_SERVER_NAME` | `SlopRock` | Name broadcast to SlopAudio Connect on the LAN |
| `SAC_SERVER_IP` | auto | Override when auto-detected IP is a VPN or Docker bridge |
| `SAC_HTTP_PORT` | same as `PORT` | Advertised port when a reverse proxy changes the external port |

## Features at a glance

### Library

- Grid view with album art, arrangement badges, tuning, and lyrics indicator
- Artist / album tree with A–Z letter filter
- Full-text search across artist, title, and album
- Filter by format, arrangement type, stem availability, tuning, and lyrics
- Sort by artist, title, recently added, tuning, or year
- Per-profile favourites
- In-place metadata editing (title, artist, album, cover art)
- One-click retune to E Standard for Eb / D / C# / C songs

### Player

- **3D highway** — depth-aware camera, per-string lane glow, Three.js rendering
- **Classic 2D highway** — Canvas-based, suitable for lower-powered devices
- Arrangement switcher (Lead / Rhythm / Bass) mid-playback
- Speed control — 0.25× to 1.5× with pitch correction (rubberband)
- Synced karaoke-style lyrics overlay (toggleable)
- Dynamic anchor zoom — fret window adjusts ahead of approaching notes
- Real-time pitch detection via YIN algorithm (compiled to WASM)
- Score submission with best-score tracking per profile

**Techniques rendered:** bends (1/2 · full · 1½ · 2), slides, hammer-ons, pull-offs, taps, palm mutes, vibrato, harmonics, pinch harmonics, accents, tremolo, unison bends

### Practice tools

- **A-B Looping** — mark any start and end point, replay instantly
- **Saved Loops** — name and store multiple loops per song across sessions
- **Mastery Slider** — gradually reveal harder notes on songs with phrase difficulty data

### Profiles & access control

- Multiple profiles on a single instance — isolated settings, scores, and loops per profile
- PIN protection with recovery phrases and admin reset
- Custom avatars
- Permission groups (Admin, Upload, Edit Tracks, Delete Tracks, Manage Settings, …)

### VST Plugin Chain (via SlopAudio Connect)

The companion app **SlopAudio Connect** connects to SlopRock over your LAN, enabling features that require direct audio hardware access:

- Route your instrument through a VST3 plugin chain (EQ, reverb, pitch shift, amp sims, …)
- View and control the chain live from the SlopRock UI — bypass, reorder, add, remove, adjust parameters
- Low-latency pitch detection fed directly from your audio interface

### Plugin System *(experimental)*

An extensible plugin architecture lets plugins add UI slots, backend routes, event hooks, and swappable service providers.

**Bundled plugins**

| Plugin | What it does |
|---|---|
| Themes | 9 built-in colour themes — persisted server-side per profile |
| Leaderboard | Per-song score tracking and leaderboard view |
| YIN Pitch Detector | Real-time pitch detection via WASM — powers the note recognition system |

> The plugin API is experimental. Breaking changes are expected until it stabilises. Legacy Sloprock (v1) plugins are not yet supported.

---

## Scalability

- Parallel metadata extraction — 4 files processed concurrently during scan
- PostgreSQL-backed search with server-side pagination — tested beyond 80,000 songs
- MinIO object storage separates binary assets from the database
- Background scanning never blocks the UI
